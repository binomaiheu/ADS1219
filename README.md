# Texas Instruments ADS1219 ADC I2C Library

Here I started an own library for the ADS1219 24-bits adc inspired by existing code, partly
to learn, partly since the existing repo's didn't seem complete. Will refactor to platformio library. 

Work in progress...

## Features
- In the library i found, (https://github.com/OM222O/ADS1219/), the DRDY pin was used to wait for the result of the conversion, here I'm using the status register as well
- I added a timeout while waiting for the conversion result such that if something goes wrong there in the code, the microcontroller doesn't hang while waiting forever for the conversion result to become available

## Architectures

At the moment my main interest if for the SAMD21 (`atmelsam`) and atmel 1284-P (`atmelavr`) Âµcontrollers, feel free to get this working on other platforms. Probably better idea to have this depend on a generic I2C communication library, but wanted to minimze dependencies there.   

## Unit tests

The library includes a number of unit tests to test the functionality of a connected ADS1219 device. These tests are included in the `test` folder. You can run them via `pio test` or pushing the test button.
